#### Project Outline
[x] - Procedurally create the Table from Data found in the database file...

[x] - Create Scraper Add-On to generate list of Styles from [usep.net](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page)...

  - Each "Legendary" Style should have checks on each Chapter

  - The checks determine weather or not that particular Chapter has been learned...
    
  - Allow user input (i.e., checking the boxes) to be written to the Database instantly...
    
  - If all Chapters have been learned, indicate it in the UI...
